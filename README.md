_pugalug
========

there can be three modes?

* "practive" (this is just a pug and a brick wall)
* "golf" (you will try to get the pug into a hole)
* "puzzle" (there will various buttons, movable objects, etc, to get past until you get the pug into a particular place)

i thought it would be cool if there was a variety of pugs/dogs you could buy
by playing and earning "heart points" which you would use to hug your dogs each day,
or buy new dogs. but if you don't "love" your dogs every day, after a
certain amount of time, they will die. this will keep people coming back.

the alternative way to earn "heart points" would be to use real money
and buy them.

i thought coins could also work vs. "heart points", but i think gaining
hearts, and "loving" your pugs would be ironic given that the main mechanic
of the game is that you kick pugs around. "hug your pug" should alert
people every day, also warning them that pugs will run off if they feel
unloved.



some inspiration for this

choices on the game
===================

* art style
* exact "punting" mechanic
* how many levels should we do on the "puzzle" version?
* environment? could use anything as long as it runs on Android and iOS
  * [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/download/)
  * [Processing](https://processing.org/) (probably going through [P5Nitro](https://github.com/davidedc/P5Nitro))
  * [Unity](http://unity3d.com/)



random ideas
============

* multiplayer "battle" version
* there can be fire hydrants randomly in the game, and every time the pug crosses one, it will be on it. every time. even mid-air it will stop to pee
* the could be an "epic" version where you can crack the brick wall, if you do it good enought you'll break through the wall. ultimately, you should be able to break through several wall, through a building, a mountain, and eventually split the world in half, if you do it right. and if you can do that, then you can even try to launch the punch through earth, and then the moon (if you're skilled), and straight into the sun. sadly, pugs can't break through suns.
* power ups! flame-throwing pugs!
